# Quick Share

A peer-to-peer quick share app.

## Purpose

Quick Share is a peer-to-peer file sharing app that allows users to share files with each other quickly and easily.
The purpose of this app is to allow users to share files with each other quickly and easily.

This app was developed to provide a faster alternative to bluetooth file sharing and to provide a more secure alternative to cloud file transfer services.

Sending data via bluetooth is a tedious process, especially for larger files which take a long time to transfer. 
Cloud file transfer services are not always secure as uploading confidential files to the cloud can expose them to potential security risks.
Cloud file transfer also stores the files on a server owned by the company which could be accessed by other third parties during malicous attacks.

Quick Share provides a secure and fast way to share files with other users without the need for online servers or cloud storage.
It accomplishes this by using LAN connections to transfer files between devices. This method is not only faster than bluetooth file transfer, 
but also provides more security than cloud file transfer services.
